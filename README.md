# Cricket-Thermometer
Android application is developed in Java to know the temperature based on the chirps of cricket.

Did you know that you can tell the temperature by counting the chirps of a cricket? It’s true!!!

The Cricket as a Thermometer
      Back in 1897, a scientist named Amos Dolbear published an article “The Cricket as a Thermometer” that noted the correlation between the ambient temperature and the rate at which crickets chirp.
      The formula expressed in that article became known as Dolbear’s Law. It’s surprisingly simple:
    
    
To convert cricket chirps to degrees Celsius:
    Count the number of chirps in 25 seconds, divide by 3, then add 4 to get the temperature.

    Example: 48 chirps /(divided by) 3 + 4 = 20° C
    
Keeping in view of this law, an Android application is developed in Java to know the temperature based on the chirps of cricket.
